# Microcontroller System Design

1. Digital I/O: Introduction to the MPLAB-X IDE (Integrated Development Environment), the tool-chain used for the PIC32 microcontroller found on the uC32 Digilent development board

2. Protocol Communication: Develop a UART device driver library to implement an interrupt-driven full-duplex serial link to a remote computer. Then make use of this library by writing an independent application using this new serial driver library to communicate with a Python program running on a connected remote PC

3. Pulse Width: Introduces the general methodology associated with the engineering design of a complete system, and applies it specfically to an embedded microcontroller system using R/C servos and rotary encoders

4. Mixed Signal Digital Filter: Develops several new libraries necessary to implement a basic mixed-signal application and understand the necessary basic hardware architecture components
